## Adobe-Stock-Forecasting-Deep-Learning

This is a deep learning model that uses historical Adobe (ADBE) stock data to predict future stock prices. This implementation is done using Python with the TensorFlow and Pandas libraries.

### Requirements

* numpy
* pandas
* tensorflow
* matplotlib
* pandas-datareader
* yfinance
* scikit-learn

### Installation

To install the required libraries run:

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow matplotlib pandas-datareader yfinance scikit-learn

### Usage

This model is built using deep learning techniques like Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, Conv1D, MaxPool1D, and GlobalAvgPool1D. It uses historical stock data to predict future stock prices.

### Conclusion
This is a basic implementation of a deep learning model to predict stock prices. It can be improved by using more advanced
